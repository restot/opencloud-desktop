Feature: VFS support
    As a user
    I want to sync files with vfs
    So that I can decide which files to download

        And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some contents" to "parent/lorem.txt" in the server
        And user "Alice" has set up a client with default settings
        Then the placeholder file "testFile.txt" should exist on the file system
        And the placeholder file "parent/lorem.txt" should exist on the file system
        When user "Alice" reads the content of file "parent/lorem.txt"
