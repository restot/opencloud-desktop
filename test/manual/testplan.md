## Preparation

- create a release or test plan issue in GitHub
- copy each test section of this test plan into a separate comment in the issue
- add links to every section in the main comment
  ```
  * [ ] 1. Install, Setup and Configuration @tester1
    -> https://github.com/opencloud-eu/desktop/issues/xxxx#issuecomment-xxxxxxxxx
  * [ ] 2. Folders
    -> ...
  * [ ] 3. Files
    -> ...
  * [ ] 4. Move files and folders
    -> ...
  * [ ] 5. Edit Files

  * [ ] 7. Sync process

  * [ ] 11. Selective sync
    -> ...
  * [ ] 12. Overlay icons

  * [ ] 13. Context menu
    -> ...
  ```

- If not stated otherwise each test should be run on every platform win/linux/mac. Record the result as per platform.
- "Enable logging to temporary folder" and "Log Http traffic" (tab 'Settings', button 'Log Settings') to have log-files available if needed to report an issue.
- Make sure all automated UI tests run successfully in CI and run them locally on Windows.
- all tests that are automated are marked with a :robot: in the 'Result' column (for the corresponding platform) and the name of the test in the 'Related Comment' column
- If multiple people are working on the tests at the same time, mark the tests everyone is working on with the GitHub name of the tester.
- Add the test result to the 'Result' column. For success: :heavy_check_mark:, failure: :x: (link the reported #issue to 'Related Comment')

## Testplan

### 1. Install, Setup and Configuration

Try everything here once with Keycloak and once with Lico (the single binary builtin IdP).
To easily run a Keycloak setup, use the [deployment examples](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud/tree/main/deployments/examples/opencloud_full).
